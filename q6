6. Modify the program in 5, and add two new functions. One that will sort the elements, and the second one will reverse the elements
before printing (so before printing the list of odd numbers for example, sort then reverse then print).

var a = [17, 24, 15, 26, 19, 30, 2, 66, 40];
var b = [];

 for (i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
  if (a[i] % 2=== 0 )  {
    b.push(a[i]);
    b.sort(a[i]);
    b.reverse(a[i]);
      
  }
}
console.log(b);
